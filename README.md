# PanMAGs

This repository provides codes and files to reproduce data and figures from the manuscript "Critical assessment of pan-genomics of metagenome-assembled genomes", by Tang Li and Yanbin Yin* (*corresponding author). <br> 
<br> 
Here, the scripts cover downloading genome data, simulating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from complete genomes, doing pan-genome analysis, performing Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) functional annotations and comparing phyloegentic trees.
